# ECUSIS Map Mobile Application

ECUSIS mobile app is a Campus selector for ECUSIS WebApp.

By clicking on each button the app opens ECUSIS WebApp page for the specified campus by the url.

Clicking on the ECUSIS logo in the app opens ECUSIS WebApp page without specifying any of the campuses.

ECUSIS  WebApp displays Edith Cowan University (ECU) campuses and building information for use by managers, contractors, staff and students.

ECUSIS has been released to assist students, staff and visitors find their way around campus.

This tool gives the user the option to search for a room or building, search for a point of interest (e.g a caf√©, ATM or lecture theatre) or use the way-finding function to find the path from one building to another. We invite staff and students help us test the App and provide us with feedback.

ECUSIS is developed by IFM, an Australian Location Intelligence and Mapping Software developer.
